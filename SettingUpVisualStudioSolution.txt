Setting up a Visual Studio solution
These are notes on how to build the project with VS and keeping all the VS files out of the git repository.

-------------------------create the VS projects-------------------------

create dir 'workspace/'
clone the project in this directory, thereby creating the directory 'workspace/atl/'
create dir 'workspace/atl_VS/'

open visual studio, create a new solution by creating a new project; File -> new project -> empty project
create it in the 'workspace/atl_VS/' directory and call it 'Algebra_VS_Solution'

Create a new project in this solution called 'Algebra_vsProject', use the option 'add to Solution', Win32 project -> dll.
Create a new project in this solution called 'AlgebraTest_vsProject', use the option 'add to Solution', Win32 project -> console application.

delete the empty Algebra_VS_Solution project.

Now you have directories:

'workspace/atl/'											(the contents of the git repo)
'workspace/atl_VS/Algebra_VS_Solution'						(has Algebra_VS_solution.sln)
'workspace/atl_VS/Algebra_VS_Solution/Algebra_vsProject'		(has Algebra_vsProject.vcxproj)
'workspace/atl_VS/Algebra_VS_Solution/AlgebraTest_vsProject'	(has AlgebraTest_vsProject.vcxproj)

Drag and drop the contents of 'atl/Algebra from file explorer to Algebra_vsProject.
Drag and drop the contents of 'atl/Algebra.Test from file explorer to AlgebraTest_vsProject.

-------------------------Modify pre compiled header file-------------------------
Including the stdafx.h in every cpp file makes the code not cross-platform any more.
Modify 'stdafx.h' (in Algebra_vsProject) make it look like:

/* We use the contents of this header only on windows. 
However, other cpp files must include this header, even when not compiling on Windows.

doing something like this

	#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(__WIN32__)
	#  include "stdafx.h" //only for Windows
	#endif

won't compile on Windows.
*/
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(__WIN32__)
#pragma once

#include "targetver.h"

#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN  // Exclude rarely-used stuff from Windows headers
// Windows Header Files:
#include <windows.h>

#endif


-------------------------

(For using precompiled header in windows:
	You stdafx.cpp should include stdafx.h and be built using /Yc"stdafx.h".
	Your other *.cpp files should include stdafx.h and be built using /Yu"stdafx.h".
)

We will build without a pre compiled header:

Right click on the file stdafx.cpp and remove it from the Algebra_vsProject and then delete it.
idem for stdafx.h
idem for targetver.h
idem for dllmain.cpp


-------------------------Configure the AlgebraTest_vsProject project-------------------------

Open AlgebraTest_vsProject properties.
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General --> Additional Include Directories :

"C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_57_0";D:\path\to\workspace\atl\Algebra;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)

--make sure there are double quotes "" around the parts that have a space like "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_xx" .

Configuration Properties -> VC++ Directories --> Library Directories :
"C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_57_0\stage\lib"

also
Common Properties -> Framework and References,  click 'Add New Reference...' and add Algebra_vsProject.
